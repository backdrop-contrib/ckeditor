CKEditor
=========

**Important note**: CKEditor module was moved into Backdrop core in version 
1.2.0. Use of this module is no longer necessary and no further changes will be 
made here. If you would like to report a bug or feature request against CKEditor 
module, file an issue in the main Backdrop CMS core repository at https://github.com/backdrop/backdrop-issues.

This module is a port to Backdrop of the Drupal contributed module 'CKEditor - WYSIWYG HTML editor'. 
It allows Backdrop to replace textarea fields with CKEditor. This module provides a link between 
Backdrop and the CKEditor library which may either be downloaded from http://ckeditor.com/download
or may be linked from CDN - //cdn.ckeditor.com/4.4.3/full-all.

CKEditor is an online rich text editor that can be embedded inside web pages.
It is a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor which means that the
text edited in it looks as similar as possible to the results end users will
see after the document gets published. It brings to the Web popular editing
features found in desktop word processors such as Microsoft Word and
OpenOffice.org Writer. CKEditor is truly lightweight and does not require any
kind of installation on the client computer.

Status
------------

This is the first official release of this port to Backdrop. In a future release
of Backdrop it is expected that CKEditor will be incorporated in Core and this 
contributed module will no longer be needed.

Installation
------------

Download and install this contributed module in the usual way. It will appear
in the list of modules under the category User Interface.
There are various configuration settings. As a default it links to the CDN
at //cdn.ckeditor.com/4.4.3/full-all and so it is not necessary to install
the CKEditor library.

There are also a number of optional plugins.
